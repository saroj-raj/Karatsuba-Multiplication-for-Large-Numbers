# Karatsuba-Multiplication-for-Large-Numbers

karatsuba Multiplication for Large Numbers

## Description
This Python script implements Karatsuba's algorithm to multiply two large 64-digit integers efficiently. Karatsuba's algorithm is a divide-and-conquer technique that reduces the multiplication complexity by breaking down the large numbers into smaller components. This method is especially effective when the number of digits (n) is a power of 2, where it significantly reduces the computational cost compared to naive multiplication methods.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x

### Installing
- No special installation required, just ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

### Executing Program
- Simply run the script, and it will compute the product of two predefined 64-digit numbers.
- The script outputs the product and demonstrates the efficiency of the Karatsuba algorithm.

```bash
python karatsuba_multiplication.py
```

## Output
The script outputs the product of the two predefined 64-digit numbers. It demonstrates the effective reduction in the number of elementary multiplications required, leveraging the properties of the Karatsuba algorithm.
